An LRU Cache for Python:
====

an LRU cache for Python has been implemented and is available at:
  https://github.com/chango/hustle/tree/master/deps/liblru
This library can be used for keeping the least-recently-used objects in
memory.  There are other alternatives available, but this implementation is
much more efficient.  It is based on the work of Tim Day:
