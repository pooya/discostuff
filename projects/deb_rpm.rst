Debian and RPM packages
====

The debian package for Disco was broken and was fixed to simplify the
installtion of Disco on Debian and Ubuntu Operating Systems.
Also, a Fedora SPEC file has been created which lets us create an RPM
package for rpm-based systems (RedHat, Centos, Fedora, etc).
This sepc file can be used to create a couple of rpm packages to be used in the
rpm-based distributions.
